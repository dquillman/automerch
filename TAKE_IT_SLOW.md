## 🎯 What's Left (But We Don't Have to Do It All Now)

### Option 1: Do Nothing Right Now
- That's totally fine
- Everything is saved
- You can come back to this later
- No rush at all

### Option 2: One Tiny Step When You're Ready
When you feel up to it, we can do just ONE tiny thing:
- Maybe just open the console
- Or just look at one page
- No pressure to finish anything

### Option 3: I Can Help You Later
- Save this for another day
- Ask me to help when you're ready
- We'll go at your pace

## 🎁 What You Have Right Now

Your app works locally! That's already a huge win. The deployment is just one more step, and it can wait until you're ready.
